# RGB control with potentiometers

## Hardware components

* RGB led
* 3 potentiometers
* Arduino Uno board
* breadboard
* 3 330 ohms resistors
* connection cables

## Technical Task 

Use a separat potentiometer in controlling each of thecolor of the RGB led (Red,Green andBlue).  The control must be donewithdigital electronics(aka you must read the value of the potentiome-ter with Arduino, and write a mapped value to each of the pins connectedto the led.
