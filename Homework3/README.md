# EMF detector

## Hardware components

* 7 segments display
* 1 buzzer
* 3 330 ohms resistors
* 1 1M ohms resistor
* antenna (can be a cable)
* connection cables
* Arduino Uno Board
* 1 big breadboard
* 1 small breadboard

## Technical Task 

Basically, weâ€™re building the ghost detector (aka an EMF - electromagneticfield  -  detector). It should detect EMF (check body and near outlets, DO NOT INSERT INTO OUTLET). It should print the value on the 7-segment display (or light the led bar) and should make a sound based on the intensity.
